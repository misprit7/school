Lower bound on dissacossiation number, like independence number 

c induced cycles 1 mod 3

lower bound is n-1/3(n+k+c)

Proof by contradiction, minimal counterexample

Can't have more than one component

Using other bounds, can't be tree or cycle, longest path proof

Break down into blocks and vertices, can assume path has block then cut vertex then block, one block is on edge of graph

Assume graph is cycle disjoint, so either 0 or one blocks that are cycle in blocks attached to v

Bunch of inequality stuff

No matter where cycle is you can derive inequality

Generate new graph by removing v, can bound lower bounds on new graph to derive smaller counterexample

The paper presented was about providing a new lower bound on the dissociation number of arbitrary graphs, which describes the maximum number of vertices that induces a graph with degree at most 1. They prove that the dissociation number of a graph $G$ is less than $|G|-\frac{1}{3}(|G|+||G||+c)$, where $c$ is the number of cycles length $1\mod 3$ (I may have misremembered the specifics of this bound in terms of algebra).

They go about proving this new lower bound by considering a minimal counterexample $G$ and they consider a longest path $P$. Using various other papers they establish several properties of such a minimal counterexample, including the relative location of a cut vertex $v$ along $P$ to a block on the edge of $G$. They also show $v$ is also cycle disjoint, so at most 1 of the blocks connected to $v$ has a cycle. Using various inequalities it is possible to show that no matter what the relative arrangment of this cycle to $v$, the inequality to prove holds or it is possible to derive a smaller counterexample, a contradiction, so the inequality holds.
